Draw your own pixel art!

Choose the grid size you want (8x8, 16x16, 32x32 or a custom size), pick up a color from the wheel and just start drawing.

When you choose a color in the color wheel you are presented with a small selection of other similar colors, just in case you didn't click in the specific color you wanted.
On the right side of the canvas you can also choose from among the last used colors.

You can also choose to use a "fill" tool that lets you color great areas of your canvas with just one click using a threshold value.
